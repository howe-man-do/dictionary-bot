Dictionary Bot (Alpha)
======================

A Dictionary bot for Slack! Add it as a slash command integration. Go wild. Be word crazy. Make sure to add your pearson api key to the apiKey file or it will just use the sandbox one.

Type `/[command] [word_to_define]` and the server will respond with a definition. Surprise bonus: the response includes the word's part of speech!

You can also use /urban after you set it up on slack to define using urban dictionary.

Using [Linklater](https://github.com/hlian/linklater) and [The Pearson Dictionary API](https://developer.pearson.com/apis/dictionaries).

Many thanks to [Hao](https://github.com/hlian) and [Ian](https://github.com/ianthehenry) for Haskell help.
