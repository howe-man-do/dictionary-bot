Dictionary Bot (Alpha)
======================

A Dictionary bot for Slack! Add it as a slash command integration and go wild.

Type `/[command] [word_to_define]` and the server will respond with a definition. Surprise bonus: it has part of speech too!

Using [Linklater](https://github.com/hlian/linklater) and [The Pearson Dictionary API](https://developer.pearson.com/apis/dictionaries).

Many thanks to [Hao](https://github.com/hlian) and [Ian](https://github.com/ianthehenry) for Haskell help.
